# Crypto Recovery Finder

## Project Overview

The **Crypto Recovery Finder** is a web application designed to help users locate and recover lost cryptocurrency assets from various blockchains. By entering a wallet address or transaction hash, users can initiate a scanning process that checks multiple blockchains for recoverable assets, displaying results and recovery options in an organized manner.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-recovery-finder.git
   cd crypto-recovery-finder
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

1. **Enter Wallet Address or Transaction Hash**: In the input field, enter your cryptocurrency wallet address (in a format such as `0x...`) or a transaction hash.
2. **Click on Scan**: Hit the "Scan" button to initiate the searching process. A loading spinner will indicate that a scan is in progress.
3. **View Results**: Once the scan is completed, the results will be displayed in a table format including the asset, amount, status, and available actions for recovery.
4. **Connect Wallet**: You can connect your wallet for a more seamless experience. A pop-up will be displayed for wallet connection (e.g., MetaMask).

## Features

- User-friendly interface for easy navigation.
- Input field for wallet address or transaction hash with validation.
- Simulated scanning of multiple blockchains (currently mocked data).
- Clear results displayed in a table format.
- Setup to connect with crypto wallets (e.g., MetaMask).

## Dependencies

This project utilizes several dependencies, which are managed via `npm`. The main dependencies include:

- **express**: ^4.18.2
- **nodemon** (development only): ^3.0.2

## Project Structure
